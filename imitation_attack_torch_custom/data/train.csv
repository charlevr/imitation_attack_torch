That may be true\, but will you actually enjoy making money off the backs of people who did the best they could in difficult situations?,different

\\nYou're pushing\, and sometimes dragging me\, support has made all the difference in my life and I can never repay that\, Thank you!,different

i dont really know i just hope i am happy and spending lots of time with my family and making good money ,different
Sorry\, you still have not sold enough sprockets over the past year to justify an increase in pay.  Control your son!,different
 "Just got the package! I cant believe you remembered how much I loved that! Its got a place of honor over the fireplace."\,,same
Okay. Let me look at your HR records. Let's meet in a couple of days and talk about what we can do to help you out.,different
Once fall hits\, everyone loves to bake\, eat soup\, drink hot chocolate\, etc. You're loving the small chill and getting yourself into the feeling for winter\, so you stop caring a little bit. During the summer it's too hot to cook\, plus a lot of delicious fruits and veggies are in season. I want cool things when I'm hot. Salad\, fruit\, sandwiches\, something light and fresh. You also drink a lot more water in the summer\, which we all know you're supposed to drink a pretty hefty amount everyday year round. However\, as my mom put it to me earlier\, the minute it gets a little cold or the pants/sweaters come out\, you sort of don't care to an extent. You want cookies\, pumpkin spice everything\, etc. We even have an apple orchard that makes literally the best doughnuts I've ever had and you can bet I'm going to stock up on those babies. So your body starts taking a bit of a toll\, and only getting worse as winter hits. There's a reason we all worry about our \\,different
Larry Correia\, I love your series Monster Hunter International. I would give anything to see it made into a tv series or movie.,different
The Circus!? WILL THERE BE ELEPHANTS AND TIGHT ROPES? Can I go too? We can take the train so we can get sloppy drunk. #awwyeah,different
"I'll be in a van down by the river\, I'm sure. A bit thinner than the Farley character tho."\,,same
You are so welcome. Let's get together for a birthday lunch soon. How does your schedule look for next week?,different
So the circus came to town and I really want to go...don't know why. So I can't do this weekend...sorry. Another time maybe. ,different
Not a good day Victoria. Talk about bad luck. I had to witness my boss have a stroke...probably cause I was late to work again. ,different
there was a little tussle between spring and fall\, i did not know which i would prefer.both these seasons have more reasonable temperatures. \\nsummer is just boring too hot and 100% humidity and winter\, winter is just too cold! i think fall takes though.its the best season of all. i love it! its my favorite ,different
Hi Amber. I am having such a miserable day. I got fired for stealing from work. I can't believe they finally caught me.,different
I wanted to message you and say thanks for these flowers they are carnation and I love them and they are so fresh!,different
"It's always a little bit of a toss-up between spring and fall just because they both have more reasonable temperatures\, you know? Summer can fuck right off around here with that 100% humidity and winter\, even if mild compared to some\, is too cold. Fall wins though -- little bit less allergic to it."\,,same
You're welcome\, love you so much\, lllllll\, we'll stand by you for what you need. Here forever\, love you angel baby.......,different
I've done some dumb things and gone down the wrong path more then once but you guys have always been there with waiting arms. Thank you!,different

My mother had an accident today. She was driving a steamroller and fell out and it rolled over her. Gotta go look at her squished body...sorry I will be late for meeting. ,different
I am sorry to hear about the death of your Mother.  Do you know where the funeral parlor is so I can send some flowers?,different
Bill\, I need a raise because my mom was crushed by a steamroller and I have to go to the morgue to identify her body,different
"Mom\, Dad\, just got the new bagpipes! I really cant imagine why you waited for me to leave the house to get them for me!"\,,same
mom and dad thanks for all that you do for me you are amazing parents who have always had my back no matter waht,different
Hi Mom and Dad thank you you have been supportive for any decision any positive decisions I've made in my life and I appreciate you thank you\\n,different
"Not much different. Probably will have a new place to live though. Need a bigger bedroom."\,,same
You will be a cool parent. You work that and show those kids how cool you are. ,different
Greetings Jane.  I know it has been a goal of yours to be a superhero. Let me be the first to congratulate you on your acceptance into the Avengers. Enjoy your time defending Earth from evil alongside the best of the best of heroes. Congratulations again!. Make us proud. We will be rooting for you. ,different

"Hi Sarah. I am tired of you drinking all my milk. I know we are roommates but that milk is my milk.",same

Bad news..Mom is dead. Strange thing is there's nothing left to identify her but I have to anyways. Ever get run over by a streamroller?,different
Twitter isn't the best place to formally request something like this. Come to my office right away tomorrow morning and I'll see what I can do. ,different
Mr. Slate\, Wilma really has an issue and I think we need to get the debtasauruses of our backs. I deserve a raise.,different
New York takes some getting used to. Weird foods not even sure what your're eating cause. Lot of street vendors. How healthy is that. ,different
"Not much will have changed then. L will be about to start high school -- Ill be very uncool."\,,same
Mom and Dad\, thanks for all the love and support that you provided me through all the years. I wouldn't be where I am without you,different
\\nYou're pushing\, and sometimes dragging me\, support has made all the difference in my life and I can never repay that\, Thank you!,different
Five years from now I'll be the highest paid lawyer in the country. You won't believe how much dough I'll bring in.,different
We love you too Johnathon. Even when we know you're going to fail\, we will always be here to support you in your decisions. ,different
Amber got fired because she was stealing from work everyone knows that you are not supposed to steal from work and that's why she got fired as deserved.\\n,different
Thank you for your sweet note. We love you and can see how you handle your life in such a great manner. We are proud.,different
Judy\, that's not good. This is the second time. Let's have lunch and figure out what you can do to break the habit.,different
Victoria\, I am having a terrible day where I was first late to work and then saw my boss have a stroke. It's terrifying.,different
You are very welcome.  We did the best we could in every situation we had with you.  I pray you learned every lesson we could teach.,different
Mr Spacely\, you know how Elroy got into that trouble? I hate to do this\, but I really could use a raise to keep him out.,different
It is our mistakes and what we learn from them that ultimately define us.  We know you learned well from each mistake you made.,different
"Mom\, Dad\, not enough thanking over the years... But I gotta thank you now for letting me make some of the mistakes I made."\,,same

"Hi Amber. I am having such a miserable day. I got fired for stealing from work. I can't believe they finally caught me."\,,same
"Do you have to keep biting your fingernails like that? There are clippers to make that easy."\,,same
"Hi Mom and Dad. Thank you for all the love and support that you have provided me through all the years. I wouldn't be where I am at in life if it wasn't for you."\,,same
The only way of finding out why your partner doesn’t want to travel is by talking about travel a lot. Sometimes it may be as simple as the cost\, which your partner may find prohibitive. But he or she may never say so in open for fear of being judged.\\nThis happens often when you aren’t married. At this stage the financial status is still hidden\, often.\\nIf you think your partner is worried about the finances\, speak to them. Explore travel desires that won’t burn a hole in the pocket. Show your spouse traveling options with discounts and offers on tour packages.\\nIf cost is the reason\, you both need to discuss it in open. Only then you will have any chance of prevailing over your partner and convincing him or her to go on a holiday. For cheap holiday packages check out Expedia\, Thomas Cook\, Last Minute\, Cox and Kings etc.,different
"Hi Victoria. I am having such a rotten day. First I was late to work. Then my boss had a stroke. It was terrifying."\,,same
Mister slate.. Wilma needs  more money she is in a lot of debt and money would help her very much she definitely needs a raise.\\n,different

Hi Jackie. I have to change plans with you .I won't be able to go with you this weekend. The circus is in town and I feel strangely ,different
Thanks for the flowers. I love carnations. I hope they'll last for weeks. Thank you so much! They are beautiful,different
Hey Jackie\, I will need to cancel this weekend there is a circus this weekend and I must attend!!!!!!!,different
Mr. Spacely\, do you know what happened with Elroy? I don't like to do this but I could really use a raise considering.,different
Mr Slate\, I have a problem and I really need a raise. Is there anyway that we can make this happen at all?,different
Mom and dad. thank you for everything you've provided for me from day one. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for you.,different
The end of this movie will surprise you so don't leave before it's over..you will be sorry. A real unexpected switch up\,,different
Hi Mom and Dad thank you for all the love and support you have given me over the years.  thank you for all the love and support you have given me over the years I appreciate it.\\n,different
you are the best i love my gift you know me so well and know exactly what i like thanks again for the best present ever,different
I think if you let me help Elroy out a bit and show that I can get him to turn around\, I feel that will justify the raise. ,different
Forest Gump is so heartwarming. You just want to take him home and care for him. He never grows up.And we don't want him to.  ,different
Beth\, I love that movie\, too. I just watched that again 2 weeks ago. There are some great lessons in that movie.,different
mom and dad i love my new car thanks so much i really needed a new one and now i have one i love it its great,different
"Probably a game or something like that\, although I was looking at some Bluetooth earbuds the other day too. Those might be nice -- my headphones start to hurt my ears after a while because of my glasses. Not sure how much you plan to spend though. A gift card always works or even a gift code or whatever to Amazon."\,,same
I was amazed and in awe of the foots and culture of New York. They eat way different food from us which was interesting,different
"In five years I will be the highest paid attorney in America. You won't believe how much money I'll be making off all the high profile malpractice suites."\,,same
Haha. No problem\, honey. We all make mistakes and the important thing is to lear from them\, which we know you did.,different
I was so impressed with the New Yorkians and there ways\, especially the foods that they eat since they are quite delicious.,different
We love you honey so much. We'll be here for you thru everything. Love you so much keep going in your education we here.,different
This response does not seem appropriate for your boss.  If you really want to receive a raise\, maybe you should actually describe why you deserve one.,different
"Hi Wanda. I can't believe winter is finally here. It is my absolute favorite season. I love the holidays. Christmas is my favorite.  I love all the snow too. I hope we get tons of it this year. I can't wait to build the biggest snow fort humanity has ever seen. I'll contact Guiness because I am sure it will set a world record."\,,same
You're pushing\, and sometimes dragging me\, support has made all the difference in my life and I can never repay that\, Thank you!,different
Honey your so welcome. We love you so much and are so blessed you're our baby. What would do without you. You are our angelbaby.,different
You've done a great job\, i'm happy to offer you a raise of 10percent. Will that meet your needs? I hope so please let me know,different
I just got your package you sent it had his own place over my fireplace I really appreciate it I can't wait to show you. I think you will love it just as much as I do.\\n,different
"The best scene is the one at the very end -- you'll know it when you see it... Slow-motion\, great song\, absurd situation."\,,same
We love you so much\, your such an angel. We'll always be here for you. We'll stand beside you because we love. you.,different
Mr. Slate\, I will happily take care of this debtasauruses issue and get it off all of our backs. Afterwards I would like to talk about a raise. ,different
"Mr Spacely\, you know how Elroy got into that trouble? I hate to do this\, but I really could use a raise to keep him out."\,,same
"I think we should head up to Gatlinburg. It's not that far of a drive and you can find places to stay that aren't too terribly expensive. You remember the last time we were there? That was a hoot. It will probably be a very different kind of trip with the kiddos\, but probably more fun too for that matter."\,,same
Well\, I think if we can help Wilma get the debtasuruses off our backs the raise will be a slam dunk. MR. Slate can't say no if we are amazing.,different
Lol. We sure hope your walls are soundproof so your neighbors aren't disturbed. Know you have wanted them a long time.,different
my favorite movie is its all about mary i can watch that movie a hundred times and never get sick of it,different
Mr slate. Wilma is in debt. She really needs to raise it would help her out a lot and the situation she is in one of my definitely need needs a raise.\\n,different
I have just received your gift!  You remembered and I love it so and will put it above my fireplace!!!,different
"I think a new coffee maker would be perfect. The one I have is getting a bit dodgy. I mean\, it works fine most of the time\, but the sounds it makes are getting to be a little worrisome\, like maybe it's just deciding on the day to quit. That would make for a lousy start to a day\, whatever day it did."\,,same
"Hi Jackie. I won't be able to go with you this weekend. The circus is in town and I feel strangely compelled to go to it instead."\,,same
You love me for who I am and I can't think of any other individuals who would put up with me. thank you. ,different
I am so sorry about Elroy's troubles. Let's schedule a meeting for next week to talk about a raise.  How is Wednesday?,different
Thanks so much for the flowers. I love carnations. I hope they last long! At least for a few days anyway! Thanks again!,different
Dont be so hard on yourself. Set bigger goals for your self and stride for them,different
Hey Cam. I can't wait until summer arrives. It's my absolute favorite season. I Love the blue sky and hot beaches. I love the sounds of the street vendors and barking dogs. Best of all its warm and sunny. I can feel the suns warm rays on me right now. I am so ready for it to get here. Winter Sucks. ,different
Wanda\, Can you believe winter is finally here? I absolutely love winter time. The holidays are just amazing\, especially Christmas. I actually like the snow too. I am hoping we get a lot of snow this year! I plan to build a huge snow fort - the biggest anyone has ever seen. I'll have to get in touch with Guiness to be sure I set the world record.,different
